# About

This console program was created as part of a university project to simulate a bookstore management system. In this system, there are several types of employees: the cashier, the manager, and the stocker. 

- Everyone must log in to the application.
- Only the **bookstore manager** can create and eliminate other employees.
- Only the **stocker** can add new products to the stock.
